# React Native TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'property')

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'property')`. This typically happens when trying to access properties of an object before the object or a nested property is properly defined or populated, often due to asynchronous data fetching.

The `bug.js` file shows the error, and `bugSolution.js` demonstrates how to solve the problem using optional chaining and nullish coalescing.
