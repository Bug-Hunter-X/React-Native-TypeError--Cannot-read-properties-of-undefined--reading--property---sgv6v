This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  It's common in React Native when fetching data asynchronously.  For example, if you're trying to render data from a fetch request before the data has arrived, you'll get a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'property')`.  Another scenario is when dealing with nested objects; if a parent object is null or undefined, you cannot access its child properties.
